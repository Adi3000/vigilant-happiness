#v1.0 goals

- List every meal

## Vigilant Happiness

To be fair, I found that name incredibly cool, so 
I'll stick with it. The goals of this project are very simple:

1) I'm trying to catch up on a 5-years-ish lateness on Spring Boot
and current technologies, so here is Vigilant Happiness.
2) I CANNOT make my weekly grocery list without forgetting a
component, resulting in going multiple times a week shopping.
3) I'd like to enjoy self-centered coding a bit again. Has been
a long time since I didn't pick up an IDE for the sake of it.
   

## Excuse me, but ahm... What is this ?

Good question, fella. The name is fortunately crystal clear: it is
a **grocery list manager**. The final goal is having your list of meals
on-the-go. You select your meals for the week to come, you click "Generate",
and **BOOM!** your checklist is created. All you have to do then is to pull
up your favorite drive-in grocery shop and buy ingredients one by one. Never 
again shall you forget your tomato sauce for your *hachis parmentier*.
